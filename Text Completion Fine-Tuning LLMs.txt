Text Completion Fine-Tuning LLMs

This repository provides a guide on 'fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for text completion' using 'Hugging Face Transformers'.
The included Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to train and fine-tune a pre-trained LLM for generating high-quality text completions.

Features

- Fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-3)  
- Custom dataset preparation for 'text completion'
- Training pipeline using 'Hugging Face's Trainer API'  
- Evaluation and inference for generating text
